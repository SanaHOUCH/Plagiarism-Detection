  Technology surrounds almost everyone in modern society today. 
  It affects both work and leisure activities. Technology contains information that many would rather it did not have. 
  It influences minds in good and bad ways, and it allows people to share information,
   which they would otherwise not be able to attain. Even if a person does not own a computer 
   or have credit cards, there is information on a computer somewhere about everyone. The technology,
    which is just now beginning to be disrupted and hacked, is affecting the minds of young people in
     ways that could be harmful. It is affecting our immediate future. It also gives another form of communication
      and exchange of information, which was not available before, information that is both good and bad. 
      Technology is the driving force of the future; it is changing our lives and shaping our future rapidly.
   The new technology will have a major impact in all of our lives.
    Technology has improved the way people feed,
     clothe and shelter themselves. Technology has also changed other aspects of everyday life, 
     such as health care, education, job satisfaction, and leisure time activities.
      People call the age were in today the "Technological Age" because of society's dependence on technology.
       For the first time in human history, almost all the goods and services people use depend on technology. 
       The products of technology are available to almost everyone in society. .
