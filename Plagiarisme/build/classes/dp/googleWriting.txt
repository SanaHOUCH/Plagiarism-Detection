Is today’s technology a positive advancement? Over the past few years technology has taken over society.
 Everyone uses technology, from children and teenagers to adults and elders. Technology is vital in today’s
  world and makes everything easier, but can cause laziness and some to abuse it. Some examples are the computer, 
  television, cell phone, and videogame systems. Technology has influenced people and their daily lives, 
  some better than others.

Technology has made an impact on retail. Now-a-days people do not need to leave their houses in order to get what they want.
 For example, there is no more need to go to the mall if one can order clothes online.
  There is no longer any need to get tired from walking around the malls, instead just go online and shop!

Education has enhanced in schools. Learning as well as teaching has improved and became easier.
 In every class room there is a computer but not only that, there is a smart board. This helps teachers write on 
 the board more efficiently and gives a big screen to learn better from.. Technology has also helped children with
  learning by providing computers. Computers allow access to multiple programs as well as the internet. 
  The programs created by Microsoft have tremendously improved education. Work can be done a lot faster by using
   Microsoft Word. This is a huge help because it makes papers a lot neater and gives people who have sloppy handwriting 
   a nice clean paper to hand in. Microsoft Word spell-checks and corrects the work.. PowerPoint and Excel have improved 
   work. It provides an easy way to present and stay organized with charts and graphs. Computers have made job searching
    and getting a job stress-free. People can go on a company’s website and apply right then and there.
     People can as well send resumes online through email to a company. This allows quick and easy replies to getting
      the job.
